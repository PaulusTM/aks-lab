                      [List all available virtual machine sizes in a region]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list)
                      [List all available virtual machine sizes for resizing](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/listavailablesizes).
                      For more information about virtual machine sizes, see [Sizes
